PC/IX 4.x
Interactive UNIX, also known as PC/IX, and 386/ix were UNIX derivitives created for the IBM PC in the early 1980's. PC/IX was the first UNIX sold directly from IBM, but not the first UNIX sold for the IBM PC. (Venix/86 was the first.) The original PC/IX software sold was on 19 floppy disks and sold for 900 dollars. In 1985, 386/ix was introduced, later named Interactive UNIX. The last version released was 4.1.1 in July 1998 and was supported up until 2006.
