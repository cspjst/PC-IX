The 3Com EtherLink II (model 3C503) 
I/O base 0x300 and IRQ 5 is well-supported in Interactive UNIX System V/386 Release 4.1.1, using the ie (Intelligent Ethernet) driver—despite the card being from 3Com, not Intel.

Note: In ISC UNIX (and SVR3.2), the ie driver supports several 8/16-bit ISA Ethernet cards that use a NE1000/NE2000-compatible register interface, including the 3C503. This is historical naming—don’t let “ie” (often associated with Intel) confuse you.

Step-by-Step Setup for 3C503 in Interactive UNIX 4.1.1
1. Confirm Hardware Settings
Your card is likely configured as:

I/O Base: 0x300 → matches 3c0 in your note
IRQ: 5 → matches 5 in 3c05
Transceiver: AUI (default) or BNC—ensure correct cabling
The 3C503 uses jumpers or a configuration utility (3C503CFG.EXE in DOS) to set base/IRQ. Verify with a DOS boot floppy if unsure.

2. Enable the ie Driver in the Kernel
Interactive UNIX requires explicit driver binding via idtune.

Run as root: 			/etc/conf/bin/idtune ie 0x300 5

First argument: I/O base address in hex (0x300)
Second argument: IRQ number (5)
This writes the configuration to the kernel symbol table.

3. Rebuild the Kernel

/etc/conf/bin/idbuild -B

The -B flag builds and installs the new kernel (/unix).
Reboot is required afterward.
4. Configure Networking
Edit /etc/netconfig: (Important: No spaces around = in /etc/netconfig.)

hostname=yourhost
ipaddr=192.168.1.10
netmask=255.255.255.0
gateway=192.168.1.1

Add to /etc/hosts:

127.0.0.1       localhost
192.168.1.10    yourhost

5. Reboot sync; reboot

6. Verify After Reboot
Check if the driver loaded:	dmesg | grep ie

You should see something like:	ie0: 3c503 at 0x300, irq 5

Check interface status:		netstat -i

Output should include ie0 with your IP.
Test connectivity:		ping 192.168.1.1

Common Pitfalls
A. “Device not found” or no ie0 in netstat -i
Cause: Incorrect I/O/IRQ, or card not seated.
Fix: Double-check jumper settings. Try 0x280 or 0x330 if unsure—0x300 is standard, but not universal.
B. Network works but no DNS
Expected: ISC UNIX 4.1.1 has no DNS resolver.
Workaround: Use /etc/hosts for all name resolution.
C. “Network is unreachable”
Ensure gateway is set in /etc/netconfig.
Confirm physical layer: 3C503 often requires AUI-to-BNC transceiver for coax, or AUI-to-RJ45 for twisted pair.

Final Notes
The 3C503 is a period-correct, fully supported card for ISC UNIX 4.1.1.
You do not need ifconfig—networking is fully functional via static config.
Once set up, you can use rcp, rlogin, telnet, and ftp (if installed).
